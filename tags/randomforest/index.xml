      <description>Objective: The goal of the project was to utilise the dataset to identify the market share of The University of Melbourne, predictive modelling on the application data to estimate the student enrolment rate and inferring the factors that are responsible for the enrolment rate. The dataset was a large excel file which had over 450,000 rows and 350 columns. It had de-identified data on the offer to enrolment outcomes of students who applied together with their demographic data via the Victorian Tertiary Admission Centre (VTAC) for the undergraduate programs for the last 5 years.</description>
