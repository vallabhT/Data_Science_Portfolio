      <description>The aim of the project was to produce an interactive interfact that could help local citizens that commute to the CBD. Built a Tableau dashboard that could help the commuters identify the available on-street parking spots that are available for use in the city in real time.

      <description>The aim of the analysis was to build a dashboard that can help VicRoads to identify different patterns that have been persistent in the traffic accidents that have taken place in the last 6 years. The dashboard that I built helps us identify the social crash cost of accidents at different locations, varieties of the road geomerty and the attmospheric conditions that affect the causation of an accident. There were over 9 datasets used in analysis.</description>
